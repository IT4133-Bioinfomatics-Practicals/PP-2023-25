1. Write a Python program to perform the tasks given below using DNA sequence AGCTTTC-
GAATTCGA.
(a) Identify the all unique palindromic substrings (sequences that read the same forward and backward).
(b) Calculate the GC content percentage of each palindrome.
(c) Find the longest palindromic substring.
Note: Count the occurrences of G and C in each unique palindromic sequence to calculate the GC content percentage.


2. Write a Python program to perform differential expression analysis on a single-cell RNA-Seq dataset. The program should identify genes that are significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in the 'treated' group compared to the 'control' group. Use the dataset "dea.csv," located in the Bioinfo/resources/ folder of your shared drive, to complete this task.
(a) Load the dataset into a dataframe.
(b) Display a summary description of the data in the DataFrame.
(c) Compute the mean expression of each gene for treated and control samples.
(d) For each gene, calculate the fold change between treated and control groups.
(e) The thresholds for fold change are 1.6 for up-regulated genes and <0.67 for down-regulated genes Identify the up-regulated and down-regulated genes based on these criteria.
(f) Plot the fold changes in a bar chart.
